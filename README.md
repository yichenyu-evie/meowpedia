Work as Web designer & developer. 2020

MeowPedia aims to be a fun education website that introduces the features of five different cat breeds. It uses a full-screen vertical slider and interactive animation to deliver a delightful experience with a short quiz at the end. JavaScript plug-ins and JQuery are involved in the development to shape the website experience.
